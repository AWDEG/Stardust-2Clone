# Stardust 2.0 -  Based on SWGEmu Core3

## What is Stardust

Stardust is a culmination of one person's vision of what Star Wars Galaxies could have been.   A balanced gameplay experience built around fast paced and high end PvP and PvE Content.     This repository represents an effort to bring the work of the now deprecated original Stardust Repository into parity with the current optimizations released by the Core SWGEmu team handling a variety of fixes to everything from AI behavior to pathing, and more.
