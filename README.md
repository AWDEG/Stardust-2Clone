# Stardust 2.0 -  Based on SWGEmu Core3

## What is Stardust?

Stardust as it was prior to it's shutdown was a culmination of one person's vision of what Star Wars Galaxies could have been.   A balanced gameplay experience built around fast paced and high end PvP and PvE Content.     This repository represents an effort to bring the work of the now deprecated original Stardust Repository( https://github.com/Levarrishawk/Stardust/ ) into parity with the current optimizations released by the Core SWGEmu team since the original Repo was forked off from the flagship project in early 2018.   This brings Optimizations to AI / Pathfinding / and a slew of stability fixes.   With it also brings complications.    The old Repo will for the duration of the reconstruction serve as reference material but most of the screenplay structure has changed and won't simply be able to plug and play nice with the old material.

## Why the hell am I (Levarris) doing this again?

Apparently I am extremely masochistic.

## Will there ever be a new Stardust Server?

"Who can say where the road goes?
Where the day flows? Only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose? Only time"

## Is there any timeline for a "2.0" Release?

No, but you can join a discord channel I created if you want to be berated by me for asking dumb questions.   https://discord.gg/vZJuteqJFf

## How to Build
