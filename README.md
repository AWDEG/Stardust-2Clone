# Stardust 2.0 -  Based on SWGEmu Core3

## What is Stardust

Stardust as it was prior to it's shutdown was a culmination of one person's vision of what Star Wars Galaxies could have been.   A balanced gameplay experience built around fast paced and high end PvP and PvE Content.     This repository represents an effort to bring the work of the now deprecated original Stardust Repository( https://github.com/Levarrishawk/Stardust/ ) into parity with the current optimizations released by the Core SWGEmu team since the original Repo was forked off from the flagship project in early 2018.   This brings Optimizations to AI / Pathfinding / and a slew of stability fixes.   With it also brings complications.    The old Repo will for the duration of the reconstruction serve as reference material but most of the screenplay structure has changed and won't simply be able to plug and play nice with the old material.

## Why the hell am I (Levarris) doing this again?

Boredom.   While I don't have any desire to run a server community again lest I face the same problems as before which prompted me to give up I do quite miss the work and the creative outlet that development work brought to my life so... Here i am.

## Will there ever be a new Stardust Server?

Maybe, but I won't be the one to run it I can guarantee you that. 

## Is there any timeline for a "2.0" Release?

No, but you can join a discord channel I created if you want to be berated by me for asking dumb questions.   https://discord.gg/vZJuteqJFf

## How to Build

 *  Go ask SWGEmu,  I'm not helping you with that,  besides this repo is going to be an absolutely broken mess until it's at a Release state.   You really shouldn't bother.
